(Web_Scraper) Fourth Project Done under the internship for SkillCraft Technology 

        This web scraper, written in Python, extracts product information from the Shopper Stop website. 
        It retrieves details such as product titles, codes, prices, and available sizes for items in the men's clothing section.
         The scraper uses Selenium to handle dynamic content and saves the collected data into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
